???: [[Yo|What's up|Salutations]]! Nice to meet you!
You: Is someone in my head? Hello? Who are you?!
???: Who am I? Do you really care?
- Of course!
	Graveri: What a nice person you are! I'm Graveri!
- Not really...
	???: How rude!!!
	Graveri: Well not that you care, but I'm Graveri.

Graveri: Anyways, you're probably wondering why you're here...
- Yeah! What are you doing in my head?!
- Nah, happens all the time
	You: Wait, no it doesn't! How are we talking right now?
Graveri: Oh that? I'm using a magic stone that your father left me. He said you might be wearing a similar stone. 
Graveri: Well, are you?
You: Yeah. My uncle only said it was very special, and that I should never lose it.
Graveri: Sounds about right. Your uncle is who we sent you to once the wars broke out when you were still just a baby. 
You: Wars? Uncle Bryant never told me anything about any wars.
Graveri: It was all to protect you, my boy! 
Graveri: Here in Bleakvale (yeah, happy name I know...) we've been under constant war since our king died. It's been a bit of a mess...
- What does that have to do with me?
	Graveri: A lot, actually!
- That's terrible!
	Graveri: Thanks for saying that!
Graveri: I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the king was your father. 
Graveri: It pains me to be the one to tell you. By the sound of things, I don't think you ever knew that...
Graveri: Coupled with the fact that he really wanted to meet you before his untimely demise... well...

Graveri: ARGHH!!!!

Graveri: Sorry, it just ticks me off sometimes! A boy should know his father!

Graveri: Anyway, now that we've made contact, you're needed here. All eyes are on you to restore Bleakvale.
Graveri: I won't lie... It's dangerous. Rival lords have torn this place apart, each claiming they're the rightful ruler.

- But I'm no king...
	Graveri: You might not feel like one, but whether you like it or not, you are next in line.
	=> gathering_info
- Tell me more about these rival lords.
	Graveri: There are three major factions: the Black Oath, the Golden Banner, and the Twisted Fates.
	Graveri: Each one thinks they have a claim to the throne. None of them will welcome you easily.
	=> gathering_info
- Is there a way to avoid this war altogether?
	Graveri: Possibly, but it would mean forsaking Bleakvale. Your fatherâ€™s dream would die here.
	Graveri: If you run, everything he built goes to ruin.
	=> gathering_info
- All right. I think I understand the gist of things. How do I get to Bleakvale?

Graveri: Hold your horses there, your majesty!
Graveri: Before you decide, I have to show you something. Something you'll need to see.
Graveri: Oh, and another thing...
Graveri: Our court wizard Zeno vanished right after your father was killed, but I happen to know a bit of magic myself!
Graveri: What kind of general would I be if I didn't!
You: A general? I seriously have a whole army waiting for me?
Graveri: That you do, young majesty.
Graveri: Now, I don't have too much experience actually using magic on OTHERS per se, but I bugged old Zeno enough to get him to teach me a teleport spell!
Graveri: -thinking- So I could teleport to the girl's hot springs... Har har har! 

- Are you sure this is safe?
	Graveri: Of course! Well, at least I think so...
	Graveri: It doesn't matter! It's our only option! 
	Graveri: It's not like we can go asking for one of the other court wizards for help or something.
- I'm leaving. I never asked for this.
	Graveri: If that's really what you want, I'll not force you. But you'll always wonder what might've been...
	You: Fine. What other choice do I have?
- Remain silent
	Graveri: -sighs- Silence can be an answer, too. I know you must have a million things running through your mind right now. Let's get going, though. Maybe you'll find your resolve on the way.

Graveri: No matter what path you choose, Bleakvale's fate is now intertwined with yours.
Graveri: Now prepare yourself!
